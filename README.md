- The **backend** handles socket connections, broadcasting drawing events, and optionally saving sessions.  
- The **frontend** provides UI for drawing and capturing user actions, forwarding them to the backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 14.x recommended)  
- npm or yarn  
- (Optional) MongoDB or other DB if persistence is required

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WaruniGunasena/Real-time-whiteboard-sharing-App.git
   cd Real-time-whiteboard-sharing-App
   ```

2. Install dependencies for backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies for frontend (if separate):
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install   # or yarn
   ```

4. Create an `.env` file in backend (and frontend if needed).  

### Running Locally

1. Start backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start
   ```

2. Start frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev   # or serve the static files via a simple HTTP server
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port your frontend uses).

## Usage

- Open multiple browser windows or devices  
- Enter the same room or drawing session ID  
- Draw on the whiteboard and see updates appear in real time on all clients  
- Use UI controls to clear board, undo, etc

## Configuration / Environment Variables

Here are some common environment variables you might want to configure in `.env`:

```text
PORT=3000
SOCKET_PORT=5000
# If using a database
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/whiteboard
```

Be sure to load them in your backend code (e.g. via `dotenv`).
